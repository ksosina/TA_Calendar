## Creating a calendar for all TAs

### How to use

1. Install the following packages c("data.table", "dplyr","chron", "googlesheets4", "googledrive"). A code is provided below for google stuff

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/googledrive")
devtools::install_github("tidyverse/googlesheets4")
```

2. To use the google sheets you'd need to sign in.

3. In the google sheets file, you must have info for all TAs. 1 means present and 0 means absent.  In addition, have two columns identifying the date range where people might be absent (see line 13 in create_620s_cl.R )

4. You need to know the start and end date, the dates where no labs are held, and the dates where TAs are doubled.

5. Optionally you might need to know the experienced TAs so you can double up in the first week. The code is not here.

6. Run all codes in example codes to see how it works.

7. Save and upload to google calendar for the TA account
